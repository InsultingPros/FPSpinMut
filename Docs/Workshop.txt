[h1][b]General Information[/b][/h1]
This mutator fixes some nasty TWI [b][i]features[/i][/b].
[spoiler]for more info check attached videos[/spoiler]
[list]
[*] FleshPounds won't spin other FleshPounds. Allows to kill them reliably and safely.
[*] FleshPounds won't launch zeds if you kill them faster than their rage animation duration. Allows to avoid huge fuckups.
[*] FleshPounds are still able to spin smaller zeds. I didn't touch that since it allows players to block entire hallways with 1 FP. Or block that raged FP with bloats, husks, etc.
[/list]

[list]
[*] Dedicated server: all clients will level up, get achievs.
[*] Listened server: except the host itself, all clients will level up, get achievs.
